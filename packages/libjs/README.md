This project is driven by 3 Webpack configurations:

* dev
  * Webpack dashboard + bundle analyzer (port 3001) + directory src/ file watcher
* build
  * generates production bundle in repo root directory dist/@casinocoin/libjs
* test
  * functional but full coverage is a WIP

### Key CLI Commands

```bash
# starts Webpack development console and watches packages/libjs/src directory
$ npm run dev

# builds Web-targeted (UMD) package in top-level dist/@casinocoin/libjs directory
$ npm run web

# builds Node-targeted (Commonjs) package in top-level dist/@casinocoin/libjs directory
$ npm run build

# test (server)
npm run test:server

# test (client)
$ npm run test:client
```

## Running tests

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the repository and install dependencies with `npm install`
3. `npm test` or `npm test --coverage` (`istanbul` will create coverage reports in coverage/lcov-report/`)

## Generating Documentation

The continuous integration tests require that the documentation stays up-to-date. If you make changes to the JSON schemas, fixtures, or documentation sources, you must update the documentation by running `npm run docgen`.
